My CMEE 2016-17 Coursework Repository

This repository contains assignments I submitted for the coursework part of a Master's in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE). Each directory has a readme, detailing its files.

An overview of assignment topics per directory:

### 'Week2' - Basic Python ###
Assign variables

Data structures - list, tuple, set, dictionary

Input/output

Control statements - 'if', 'else', 'elif'

Debugging and unit testing
	'doctest' package
	Use 'pdb' to turn on the debugger
	Breakpoints - use 'ipdb.set_trace()' to pause programs and start debugging


### 'Week7' - Advanced Python, November 14-18 ###
Regular expressions

Number crunching with the 'scipy' package
	Scipy arrays
	'scipy.integrate' subpackage (for numerical integration)

Profiling - know which parts of code take the most time - useful for optimising speed
	'%run -p' iPython magic command
